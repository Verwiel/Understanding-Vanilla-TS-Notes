# Understanding Typescript
These are the notes taken on my [Understanding Typescript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) Udemy course.

To check out the different files, just switch the src in index.html to whichever file you want to see

``` <script src='./dist/app.js' defer></script> ```


Open 2 terminal windows and run ``` npm start ``` in one and ```tsc -w``` in the other
